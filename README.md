# Game Data Analysis

The objective of this project is to analyze game data and categorize players into three groups: bad performers, normal performers, and good performers. The project involves data processing, visualization, and k-means clustering.

## Game Description

In the game, players are presented with a sequence of individual letters on the screen, one at a time. The game consists of multiple levels:
- **Level 1**: Players must press the green button when the current letter matches the previous one.
- **Level 2**: Players press the green button if the current letter matches the one shown two positions earlier.
- **Level 3**: Players press the green button if the current letter matches the one shown three positions earlier.
